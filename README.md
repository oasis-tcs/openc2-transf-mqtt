Members of the OASIS [Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Technical
Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2)
use this GitHub repository as part of the [TC's chartered
work](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php).
Contributors must be Members of the TC. Work is governed by the
OASIS policies and is not done under typical open source

## _Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages Via MQTT_

This specification provides guidance to the OpenC2 implementation
community when utilizing MQTT for OpenC2 message transport.

### Repository Organization

![branches](images/repo-branches.png)

OpenC2 work product repositories are organized a bit differently
than typical open source software project repositories:

* The **Published** (default) branch represents the current,
  stable, approved version of the work product. If the product
  hasn't progressed past an [OASIS Committee Specification Draft
  (CSD)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#committeeDraft),
  this branch is essentially empty
* The **Working** branch is where all work-in-progress content is
  captured, and is the place to go for the [current working
  version](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-transf-mqtt/blob/working/transf-mqtt-v1.0.md)
  of this work product

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This GitHub repository supports development of content and change tracking for the OpenC2 MQTT transfer specification as new working draft level revisions are created and the associated CSDs mature. 

The repository is designed to support TC members' work on a formal specification that describes the use of Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 messages. MQTT provides a lightweight publish/subscribe reliable messaging transport protocol suitable for communication in M2M/IoT contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.  This specification provides guidance to the OpenC2 implementation community when utilizing MQTT for OpenC2 message transport.

The provisional Work Product title for the work is: "Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via MQTT, Version 1.0", edited by David Lemire (HII). The specification explains the transfer of OpenC2 command and response messages using MQTT.

### Branching Strategy

This repository is organized with two fundamental branches:

 * The *_Working_* branch contains work product 
 material that is actively being developed, and 
 subject to potentially frequent and significant 
 change. Contributors to the work product should 
 target their inputs to the Working branch.


 * The *_Published_* branch contains TC-approved 
[Committee Specification](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dCommitteeSpec) (CS) or [OASIS Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dOASISstandard) 
versions of the work product. Until the first CS 
is approved, the Master branch will not contain 
a complete version of the work product.
