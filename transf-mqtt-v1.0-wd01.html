<h3 id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a widely used publish / subscribe (pub/sub) transfer protocol. This specification describes the use of MQTT as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 messages.</p>

<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a command is encoded by an OpenC2 Producer (managing application) and transferred to an OpenC2 Consumer (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transport protocol, and the Consumer can respond with status and any requested information.</p>
<p>OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices. These capabilities permit the managing application to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed device. The capability definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner, allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.</p>

<h2 id="16-overview">1.6 Overview</h2>
<p>OpenC2 is a suite of specifications to command actuators that execute cyber defense functions. These specifications include the OpenC2 Language Specification, Actuator Profiles, and Transfer Specifications. The OpenC2 Language Specification and Actuator Profile specifications focus on the language content and meaning at the producer and consumer of the command and response while the transfer specifications focus on the protocols for their exchange.<br />
In general, there are two types of participants involved in the exchange of OpenC2 messages, as depicted in Figure 1-1:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>OpenC2 Producers</strong>: An OpenC2 Producer is an entity that creates commands to provide instruction to one or more systems to act in accordance with the content of the command. An OpenC2 Producer may receive and process responses in conjunction with a command.</li>
<li><strong>OpenC2 Consumers</strong>: An OpenC2 Consumer is an entity that receives and may act upon an OpenC2 command. An OpenC2 Consumer may create responses that provide any information captured or necessary to send back to the OpenC2 Producer.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The OpenC2 Language Specification [<a href="#openc2-lang-v10">OpenC2-Lang-v1.0</a>] provides the semantics for the essential elements of the language, the structure for commands and responses, and the schema that defines the proper syntax for the language elements that represents the command or response.</li>
<li>OpenC2 Actuator Profiles specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific actuator functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may (in fact are likely) to implement multiple actuator profiles. Actuator profiles extend the language by defining specifiers that identify the actuator to the required level of precision. Actuator Profiles may define command arguments and targets that are relevant and/or unique to those actuator functions.</li>
<li>OpenC2 Transfer Specifications utilize existing protocols and standards to implement OpenC2 in specific environments. These standards are used for communications and security functions beyond the scope of the language, such as message transfer encoding, authentication, and end-to-end transport of OpenC2 messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose messages for command and control of cyber defense systems and components. A message consists of a header and a payload (<em>defined</em> as a message body in the OpenC2 Language Specification Version 1.0 and <em>specified</em> in one or more actuator profiles).</p>
<p>The language defines two payload structures:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Command</strong>: An instruction from one system known as the OpenC2 "Producer", to one or more systems, the OpenC2 "Consumer(s)", to act on the content of the command.</li>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: Any information sent back to the OpenC2 Producer as a result of the command.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="./images/MessageFlow.png" alt="no alt title" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1-1. OpenC2 Message Exchange</strong></p>
<p>OpenC2 implementations integrate the related OpenC2 specifications described above with related industry specifications, protocols, and standards. Figure 1-2 depicts the relationships among OpenC2 specifications, and their relationships to other industry standards and environment-specific implementations of OpenC2. Note that the layering of implementation aspects in the diagram is notional, and not intended to preclude any particular approach to implementing the needed functionality (for example, the use of an application-layer message signature function to provide message source authentication and integrity).</p>
<p><img src="./images/OC2LayeringModel.png" alt="no alt title" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1-2. OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model</strong></p>
<p>OpenC2 is conceptually partitioned into four layers as shown in Table 1-1.</p>

</table>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Secure Transport</strong> layer provides a communication path between the producer and the consumer. OpenC2 can be layered over any standard transport protocol.</li>
<li>The <strong>Message</strong> layer provides a transport- and content-independent mechanism for conveying requests, responses, and notifications. A transfer specification maps transport-specific protocol elements to a transport-independent set of message elements consisting of content and associated metadata.</li>
<li>The <strong>Common Content</strong> layer defines the structure of OpenC2 commands and responses and a set of common language elements used to construct them.</li>
<li>The <strong>Function-specific Content</strong> layer defines the language elements used to support a particular cyber defense function. An actuator profile defines the implementation conformance requirements for that function. OpenC2 Producers and Consumers will support one or more profiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The components of an OpenC2 Command are an action (what is to be done), a target (what is being acted upon), an optional actuator (what is performing the command), and command arguments, which influence how the command is to be performed. An action coupled with a target is sufficient to describe a complete OpenC2 Command. Though optional, the inclusion of an actuator and/or command arguments provides additional precision to a command, when needed.</p>
<p>The components of an OpenC2 Response are a numerical status code, an optional status text string, and optional results. The format of the results, if included, depend on the type or response being transferred.</p>
<h2 id="17-goal">1.7 Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of the OpenC2 Language Specification is to provide a language for interoperating between functional elements of cyber defense systems. This language used in conjunction with OpenC2 Actuator Profiles and OpenC2 Transfer Specifications allows for vendor-agnostic cybertime response to attacks.</p>
<p>The Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework defines a collection of activities, based on the traditional OODA (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act) Loop [<a href="#IACD">IACD</a>]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensing: gathering of data regarding system activities</li>
<li>Sense Making: evaluating data using analytics to understand what's happening</li>
<li>Decision Making: determining a course-of-action to respond to system events</li>
<li>Acting: Executing the course-of-action</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of OpenC2 is to enable coordinated defense in cyber-relevant time between decoupled blocks that perform cyber defense functions. OpenC2 focuses on the Acting portion of the IACD framework; the assumption that underlies the design of OpenC2 is that the sensing/analytics have been provisioned and the decision to act has been made. This goal and these assumptions guides the design of OpenC2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology Agnostic:</strong> The OpenC2 language defines a set of abstract atomic cyber defense actions in a platform and implementation agnostic manner</li>
<li><strong>Concise:</strong> An OpenC2 command is intended to convey only the essential information required to describe the action required and can be represented in a very compact form for communications-constrained environments</li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> OpenC2 commands and responses are defined abstractly and can be encoded and transferred via multiple schemes as dictated by the needs of different implementation environments</li>
<li><strong>Extensible:</strong> While OpenC2 defines a core set of actions and targets for cyber defense, the language is expected to evolve with cyber defense technologies, and permits extensions to accommodate new cyber defense technologies.</li>

<h1 id="3-security-considerations">3 Security Considerations</h1>
<p>(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that could affect security when implementing their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.</p>
<p>While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [<a href="#rfc3552">RFC3552</a>] lists “eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle” as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.</p>
<p>In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.</p>
<p>We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read <em>Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations</em>, IETF [<a href="#rfc3552">RFC3552</a>], for more information.</p>

<h1 id="4-conformance">4 Conformance</h1>
<p>(Note: The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause">OASIS TC Process</a> requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here. For the definition of "conformance clause," see <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause">OASIS Defined Terms</a>.</p>
